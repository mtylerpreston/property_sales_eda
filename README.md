# Property Value Analysis

Betterview is an Insurtech company that created a platform for generating and analyzing roofs of properties at cost/scale that was impossible until recently. Imagery of cities is captured by manned aircraft and stiched into a large orthomap with 7 cm resolution (compared to the typical 30 cm resolution of Google Maps). Betterview's platform combines image classification with human labeling to derive data on the condition of roofs based on addresses provided by their clients (primarily insurance companies.

## Modeling a Score to Summarize the Roof Data
Based on the data derived from this imagery, Betterview has created a model to quantify this data in terms of its bearing on property insurance risk. 

# Why Real Estate?
If you know many people who have bought a house (will most likely have to think outside of the Bay Area for this), you have likely heard about negotiating processes. And specifically one item that comes up frequently in these negotiating processes is the condition of the roof. It can cause deals to fall through or sellers to concede on price if it not in good shape.

It would stand to reason that many of the same factors that contribute to a roof being a bad insurance risk (having existing damage, wear, etc) may also contribute to having less value on the real estate market. To test this theory, we need data.
